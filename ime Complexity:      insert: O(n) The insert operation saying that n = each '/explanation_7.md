Time Complexity:

    insert: O(n) The insert operation saying that n = each '/', takes O(n) because there is one iteration per path part
    find: O(n) Almost the same process, iterating through input one time, O(n)
    
    
   Space Complexity:

    insert: path_parts occupies n but splitted, so takes O(n)
    find: path_parts occupies n but splitted, so takes O(n)
